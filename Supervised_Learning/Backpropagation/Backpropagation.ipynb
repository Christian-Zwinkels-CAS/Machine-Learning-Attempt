    "# Backpropagation\n",
    "This document will explain the code I used to attempt to implement the backpropagation machine learning algorithm as well as an attempt to explain my understainding of it. Later on once I have more experience I will reflect on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is it?\n",
    "Backpropagation is an algorithm that is used in neural networks to learn. It is a form of supervised learning where the user gives it training examples with features and a desired output. The machine can try to predict the output then it will use a mutivariable function in order to calculate the error of each weight and bias. It does this for each training example then it tries to find the minimum of this function (essentially finding out what weights and biases correspond to the lowest error) by using gradient descent. The algorithm starts at the last layer then it goes back one layer at a time to the last layer which is why its called backpropagation."

    "# The Neural Network\n",
    "The architecture of the neural network was simple, but I wanted my program to be able to use any size of neural network. In this example I used one with an input layer, one hidden layer, and the output layer which has only one output.\n",

    "W1 and W2 are sets of weights represented as matricies: $$ W^{(1)} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",

    "## How it predicts\n",
    "The neural network is given a trainig exaple say 0, 0 to get the hidden layers. Lets see for example how it calculates the value at h1: $$ x1 * w_{1} + x2 * w_{2} + b^{(1)} $$\n",

    "$ \\sigma $ is the activation function which in this case is the sigmoid funciton. The activation function takes an input and turns it into a value between zero and one. $$ \\sigma (x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} $$\n",
    "Initially the weights are random values and the biases are zeros, but after training these values would have changed. This whole process is called the forward pass.\n",
    "## How it learns\n",
    "Backpropagation uses a technique called gradient descent where it tries to find the minimum of a function that takes all the parameters in order to calculate the error called the cost function.\n",
    "### The cost function\n",
    "Firstly the machine needs to know how wrong it was, and to do that an error function is defined. Let $ x^{(i)} $ be the i<sup>th</sup> training example, $ y^{(i)} $ be the training examples's desired output, and $ \\hat{y}^{(i)} $ be the machine's prediction. We define the error of that training example to be the squared error: $$ C(x^{(i)}) = (\\hat{y}^{(i)} -  y^{(i)})^{2}$$\n",
    "We want to know how well it did over all the training examples so we take the average squared error for each training example letting $ m $ equal the number of training examples letting $ W $ be the set of all the weights: $$ C(W) = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\\hat{y}^{(i)}-y^{(i)})^{2} $$\n",
    "### Gradient descent\n",
    "We can not plot the cost function due to it being a multivariable function with the number of inputs being the number of weights and biases, but I will show a more simplified example in order to give an intuition of whats going on. I will later link a video that shows a really nice animation and explanation to what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple cost funtion with just one parameter is a parabola:\n",
    "![Cost function simple graph placeholder](Screenshot_1.png)\n",
    "We start at a random value of $ w $ and the goal is to minimize the cost so we need to tell the computer to change $ w $ in a way that it will get closer to the minimum point of the graph. The negative of the derivative of the graph corresponds to lowering the value of the cost funtion so we take the derivative of the cost function with respect to $ w $ \n",
    "\n",
    "If we have two parameters the simplified version of the cost funtion will be a paraboloid so instead of taking a derivative we have to take a partial derivative for every weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute this derivative we have to use the chain rule. This is where I will let the video do the explaining as it really hepls having animations and writing all the process will make this document really long.\n",
