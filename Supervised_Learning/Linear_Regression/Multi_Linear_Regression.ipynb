    "The dataset I used was one from a course on machine learning. It has two features and 47 entries. This dataset is small and that was one of the reasons that I chose it as it will make testing code much quicker. I needed to load the dataset into a format that I could use. I made a function that separated the features and the outputs to two different numpy arrays, and added an extra feature to each entry $ x_0=1 $ which I will get to why in a minute. "
